## spandrel

[spandrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel): a contingent feature,
usually pointing at a more generic structural constraint. the constraint itself
is completely loose, and can be architectural, genetic, economic, mathematical,
causal, ... this word is used often to point out that given features are not
fundamental, but are instead pointing at something fundamental.

> __example__: natural numbers are likely not fundamental, but the inductive
> process from which they arise likely are. to have a language (in the serial
> or non serial forms) whatsoever, you need a parsable grammar, which
> immediately brings into discussion something that looks like primitive
> recursion, which brings immediately into view natural numbers. i.e: at the
> point at which you're discussing natural numbers (or a counterfactual
> language in which they don't exist), you already have them.


> __note__: a related term is 'consequence', which evokes a similar
> relationship: underlying structure / situation that brings forth a phenomenon
> / structure down the line. however, i don't use these two interchangably
> exactly because 'consequence' has a temporal / causal connotation that i
> don't want to evoke. the distinction is very similar to the distinction drawn
> between the
> [local/differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus) vs
> [global/variational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations)
> perspectives in physics. consequences __happen__, spandrels are __just
> there__.

## the happy button

the happy button: an emotional muscle that meditators obtain. similar to how
body builders eventually learn how to contract indivdual muscle groups on
command, a meditator can identify individual emotions, their triggers, and how
to engage / disengage with them. this seems most prevalent as an acquired skill
in the [jhana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhyana_in_Buddhism) tradition of
meditation.

essentially, it is a switch / lever one can press emotionally that evokes a
sense of deep happiness, in exactly the same vein as the sensations one might
feel in the early stages of the jhanas.

> __note__: while i associate the happy button with jhana 1-2, and tell people
> interested in meditation to be on the lookout for it (both because the
> triggered emotion is exactly the one you're taught to conjure in those
> jhanas, and was also around the stages at which i acquired the happy button),
> i'm not entirely sure how much of it is an artifact of my particular
> circumstances, or is genuinely a skillcheck that other practioners acquire.
