## spandrel

[spandrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel): a contingent feature, usually pointing at a more generic structural constraint. the constraint itself is completely loose, and can be architectural, genetic, economic, mathematical, causal, ... this word is used often to point out that given features are not fundamental, but are instead pointing at something fundamental.

> __example__: natural numbers are likely not fundamental, but the inductive process from which they arise likely are. to have a language (in the serial or non serial forms) whatsoever, you need a parsable grammar, which immediately brings into discussion something that looks like primitive recursion, which brings immediately into view natural numbers. i.e: at the point at which you're discussing natural numbers (or a counterfactual language in which they don't exist), you already have them.


> __note__: a related term is 'consequence', which evokes a similar relationship: underlying structure / situation that brings forth a phenomenon / structure down the line. however, i don't use these two interchangably exactly because 'consequence' has a temporal / causal connotation that i don't want to evoke. the distinction is very similar to the distinction drawn between the [local/differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus) vs [global/variational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations) perspectives in physics. consequences __happen__, spandrels are __just there__.
