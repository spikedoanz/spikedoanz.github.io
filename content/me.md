## work

i'm a machine learning engineer/researcher specializing in formal methods. i
worked at morph labs, where i built agent/rl infrastructre for the
[trinity](https://www.morph.so/blog/trinity)/[gauss](https://www.math.inc/gauss)
autoformazation projects. i've also worked at a neuroscience lab building
tooling for radiologists in the browser, and synthetic data pipelines.

## languages

my lifelong hobby has always been to learn a variety of languages, human,
computer, written, spoken, played, or otherwise. what i mean by language is
very broad, essentially just any information transfer medium that has some
analogous notion of vocabulary, compositionality (i.e grammar, algebra,
harmony) and referentiability.

for human languages, i'm fluent in english and vietnamese, and intermediate at
japanese.

for computer languages, my main languages are python and lean4, but i'm also
comfortable writing rust, c, torch/tinygrad [^1], and have a working
ability to write go, cuda, idris2, and haskell.

## software

i bounce between macos, ubuntu linux (i prefer nixos, but getting ml tooling
working on nixos has always been the closest i've felt to being a protagonist
in a kafka novel) and android (graphene os). i use i3 on linux and aerospace on
mac as my flavor of tiling window manager.

for userspace software, i only ever tab between firefox and ghostty, and spend
most of my time in tmux+neovim.

my choice of software is heavily influenced by the fact that i bounce through
dozens of different computers in any given week (clusters, cloud containers,
phones, etc), and i trend towards using "the default thing" almost whenever
possible. as a result, i only very lightly configure my software, so plain zsh,
plain tmux and mostly plain neovim (just some lsps).

i'm a cautious fan of llm agent software, and use opencode, slate, claude-code
and codex for minor edits, having a fuzzy way to use unix tooling[^2], running
benchmarks and sweeps, and finding code insights. i see this as more wine
tasting than anything of a science, and use it as my main boots to the ground
method of evaluating ai progress.

## appendix

[^1]: i consider these to be distinct languages from python
[^2]: i can't for the life of me ever remember how to use ffmpeg correctly
