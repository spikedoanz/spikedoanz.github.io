for most of human history, memetics has never been a problem.

this is because for most of human history, the amount of diverse memes you came across was very limited.

very few traveled abroad, very few knew multiple languages, very few knew of a god besides their own.

the cost of information consumption was pretty high -- you had to talk to people, directly, if you wanted to get a new stock of memes.

the cost of information production was also pretty high-- if you wanted to spread a message, you either had to speak it yourself, or you had to painstakingly write a whole book by hand.

## the original sin

then gutenberg came along with his goddamn printing press.

the cost of information production collapsed to basically 0. and the rate of information consumption also collapsed.

something something fake news, something something celebrity gossip, something something television.

something something people went a wee bit mad.

but there was still the cost of logistics -- moving bits was very hard.

and there was also an associated time cost, and therefore memes didn't really cross contaminate very often.

## the second sin

then the internet came along.

the cost of moving bits dropped to 0.

the cost of consuming memes is also collapsing.

this isn't a strict science, so take whatever i say with a grain of salt. but there is a degree of 'difficulty' when it comes to what medium your memes came packaged in.

books are hard to consume. audiobooks are a bit easier. videos are easier than that. and tiktoks are the easiest form we have right now.

this means that the cost of consuming memes is also rapidly reaching 0.

i can make a meme, post it on twitter, and have someone from Bangladesh (shoutouts to my followers from Bangladesh) see it within 60 seconds flat.

this is insane.

but we are not at the end.

because there is one final cost, and this cost is the scariest -- the cost of meme production.

currently, **most** memes are being made by humans, and there is an upper bound to how many fast a human can produce memes. beyond that, scaling the human population is pretty hard. so the rate of meme production probably won't go FOOM any time in human history.

but what if that were to change?

## memees too cheap to meter

enter ai.

[ insert plot of how cheap tokens are getting oh my god ]

[ ditto for midjourney tokens ]

[ ditto for how cheap compute in general is getting, which directly makes all of the other outputs cheaper ]

so basically, at this point:

- the cost of moving memes is 0.
- the speed of moving memes is 0.
- the cost of making memes is 0.
- the cost of consuming memes is rapdily approaching 0.
- and the infectiousness of memes will only get higher from here.

## why is more meme bad?

have you ever experienced brainrot?

have you ever complained about being on your phone too much?

imagine if that was a billion times worse.

have you ever read infinite jest?

>infinite jest is about a tape, that if you watch it once, you only ever want to watch it. 
>
>you want to watch it so much that if i told you i'll let you watch it again if you chop your toe off, you'll actually do it.
>
>i think we're going to build that tape.
>
> -- geohot

we risk entertaining ourselves to death.

we risk creating the actual hedonic treadmil, and strapping ourselves to it for the rest of eternity.

and for what? how much enjoyment have you actually derived from instagram reels? or tiktoks? or youtube shorts? how much value do you think a human life composed 99% of consuming content is worth? how much value is a humanity composed 99% of these humans worth?

## a new sin

i think the way out is not through technology, but through culture.

cultural barriers are powerful things, just look at how fervently people uphold their religious tenets.

why don't we invent a new religion?

let's call it **signalism**.

the goal of signalism is to keep humanity focused.

on what, exactly? doesn't really matter. curing death, exploring the cosmos, solving math, achieving enlightenment etc etc.

signalism doesn't care about what exactly you want to get done. its only goal is to create a memetic environment that's conducive to you getting there.

doing anything worthwhile require immense focus -- gatekeeping of information.

you cannot afford getting infected by the newest batch of memes if what you want to get anything important done. almost by definition. every second you spend thinking about a stupid meme, you aren't spending that second on what matters to you.

every religion has their own set of sins.

signalism will have just one -- **noise.**

here's how to enforce it:

1. if you share slop. i am instantly blocking you.

2. if you seem hyperfixated on 'the current thing'. i am also blocking you.

3. and for all of these, i will make a public ledger. a wall of shame. the wall says "DO NOT LISTEN. DO NOT ASSOCIATE. DO NOT PROPOGATE". and you will be blocked by those who follow my ledger.

at this point, you might say "but muh echo chamber".

buddy, there's a difference between deleting tiktok and joining a neonazi group chat.

and secondly. who do you think you are? why should you deserve my time of day? what gives you the right to tell me what i should or shouldn't let into my life?

and thirdly. blocked, with love <3.
